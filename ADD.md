#App Design Document

Tribal Power

##Objective
To increase employee retention and company happiness level through creating a platform which allows employees to create requests that range from personal to professional issues, and have them answered by fellow employees.

##Audience
Businesses looking to increase team cohesion and collaboration in the workplace leading to increased synergies across divisions and lower churn rate for employees


##Experience
Employees will feel blissful ecstasy upon embarking on their first use case. Users should feel like they are coming to an old friend asking for advice, and are expecting words of wisdom to cascade from the tableview controller presenting the answers to their questions.


##Technical
This app is fairly rudimentary, the most important aspect will be to pair each user to a specific “tribe” or community which they can contribute to


####External Services
External services to this include third party frameworks and libraries from Cocoa pods. I have not yet decided which ones it is that I will be using


####Screens
The first screen will be the login for users to ensure there is security.
The second screen is the users home screen which shows the available communities or tribes for them to join. To join these tribes.
The third screen will be what the requests are
The fourth screen will be users ability to respond to requests
the fifth screen will be users ability to post requests
the sixth screen will be users ability to edit their profile
the seventh screen will be users ability to manage settings


####Views / View Controllers/ Classes
The view controllers will be an important component of the project, and will include a table view controller for presenting the requests

####Data Models
The data models used within here will be user <—> tribe/community
